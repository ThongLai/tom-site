My main role was to assist in deriving valuable insights from the dataset by categorizing fixations into \"First Pass\" (initial read) or \"Second Pass\" (subsequent read) sequences. Realizing unusual points while analyzing the data, I developed an Anomaly Detection mechanism for the dataset where using the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) to identify and remove outliers, establish criterias for accurately determining when a reader transitioned to the next line of text. These contributions notably improved the robustness and accuracy of the data analysis process.",
